# quickscripts

scripts to satisfy an urgent need.

* chext.pl
trivial script to change extension of filename given as argument

* examaln.pl
Examine alignment. Chiefly takes a large target sequence in a fasta file (first argument)
and a query multiple sequence fasta file (second argument) and runs Smith Waterman local
alignment for each query sequence on the target file.

It also reverses the target sequence and runs the sequences on it so it represents the reverse strand.

* wattq0.pl
Due to emamaln.pl being a bit complicated, wattq0.pl pares down the extras (no revrsing of target)
and just concentrates on basic functionality.
* needtq0.pl

* whatseqio.pl
A toy program.
